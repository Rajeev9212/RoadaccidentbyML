# RoadAccidentbyML  

A Machine Learning project to predict/assess road accidents in India using historical accident data. The project includes data processing, model training & evaluation, plus a simple web app interface for making predictions.

## Overview

This project uses machine learning to analyze road accident data from India and predict accidents or their severity (depending on labels). The idea is to help stakeholders (like road safety analysts, local government, etc.) make data‐driven decisions to reduce accidents.

---

## Features

* Data cleaning & preprocessing
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA) including visualizations
* Model training & saving (pickle model)
* Web interface to take input features & predict outcomes
* Easy deployment setup (Procfile, runtime, requirements)

---

## Data

* **Dataset file**: `accidents_india.csv` — contains historical traffic accident data from various Indian regions.
* **Preprocessed data**: Some features might be cleaned/encoded before model training.
* **Model file**: `test1.pkl` — the trained machine learning model saved for inference.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

* Python 3.7 or higher
* `pip` package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rajeev9212/RoadaccidentbyML.git
   cd RoadaccidentbyML
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the App

1. Make sure the model file (`test1.pkl`) is present.
2. To start the web app (using `app.py`):

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. Open your browser and go to the local URL (usually `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`) to use the prediction interface.

---

## Model

* The model is built in `Prediction Model.py`.
* It trains on the cleaned data, uses feature encoding & possibly scaling.
* After training, the model is serialized (saved) as `test1.pkl` for later use in predictions.

## Files & Structure

Here is what the main files/folders are and what they do:

| File                  | Purpose                                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `accidents_india.csv` | Original dataset of accidents in India                       |
| `Prediction Model.py` | Script to preprocess data, train model and evaluate it       |
| `test1.pkl`           | The saved (trained) model used for inference                 |
| `app.py`              | Flask (or other) web app to serve the model for predictions  |
| `requirements.txt`    | Python dependencies needed for this project                  |
| `runtime.txt`         | Specifies runtime version (for deployment)                   |
| `Procfile`            | File used by platforms like Heroku to launch the web app     |
| `graph.png`           | Visualizations / graphs created during EDA or result display |

---

## Usage

* Use the web app to make predictions: enter relevant features (such as time, location, road condition etc.) → get accident prediction or risk.
* Modify the model script to try different algorithms, tweak parameters, or use more features.
* Use the EDA (in model script or separate notebook) to understand which factors contribute most to accidents.

---

## Evaluation / Results

Describe or show how well the model performs:

* Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1‐score (or whatever metrics used)
* Also any confusion matrix or ROC curve visualization
* Mention overfitting / underfitting issues, cross‐validation if used

> *Example:* “Model achieved \~80% accuracy on test set, with recall lower for severe accident cases. Further work needed to improve prediction for minority classes.”

---

## Future Work

Some potential improvements:

* Get more data or more detailed feature data (weather, traffic volume etc.)
* Use more advanced models (e.g. ensemble methods, deep learning)
* Hyperparameter tuning for better performance
* Better user interface / deployment (mobile friendly, more interactive dashboards)
* Real‐time data integration (if possible)

If you like, I can also generate a README with Markdown styling & images inserted (if you share some graphs), to make it more polished. Do you want me to prepare that version for you?
